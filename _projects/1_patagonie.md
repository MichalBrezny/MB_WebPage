### Landslides in the Patagonia
I am a member of Tomáš Pánek’s scientific team, which is working on landslides in Patagonia. It started with the first article in 2017. Subsequently in 2019, Tomáš Pánek received a grant from the Czech Science Foundation ([https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/project/GA19-16013S](https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/project/GA19-16013S)). In this project we focused on landslides in the foothills of the Andes. This is an area that was affected by the Patagonian Ice Sheet. Our research focused on the chronology of the landslides, their distribution and the causes of their occurrence. One of the key questions was what effect deglaciation and other events such as the emptying of large lakes had on the formation of landslides. This project ended in the 2022. Now we are working on another project which is focused on large landslides in the Patagonian tableland ([https://starfos.tacr.cz/projekty/GA23-07310S](https://starfos.tacr.cz/projekty/GA23-07310S)).
