### Landslides in the Outer Western Carpathians
It is perfect to have study area less than an hour from hometown. This is the case of Czech part of Carpathians and especially the highest part – Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mts. I am working there since my bachelor studies. My thesis was about pseudokarst caves on the Kněhyně ridge. My PhD project was focused on deep-seated landslides in the Moravskoslezské Beskydy mountains. I did inventory mapping using LiDAR images, spatial analysis, dating using cosmogenic radionuclides and other stuff. 

With more than 13,000 landslides in the whole region of Czech Outer Western Carpathians, there is still a lot of work to do.
