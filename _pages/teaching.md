# Teaching
## Textbook
I wrote textbook Basics of geomorphology (in Czech). As time and mood permit, I am incrementally adding to and modifying the textbook.

## Ask the scientist
I participate in the Ask a Scientist project, where the public can ask any scientific question and receive well-founded answers from scientists. The motto of the project is 'There are no stupid questions'. I serve both as an answerer and as a reviewer of the answers.
